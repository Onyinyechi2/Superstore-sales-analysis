This is the Sales data of a superstore. It is made up of 9994 rows and 21 columns, contains information such as customer name, category of products, region, state, product name, sales, quantity and so on. 


To provide insights from this data I first needed to understand what the data is all about, so I skimmed through the data,taking note of the column names and other observations.


Next was to know what insights the client needed from the data, some which were: To know the overall performance of business, see how they performed in a particular month, region and what products performed better.
